# why virtual nodes need digest

# if a virtual node dependencies are changed and the new dependencies 
# do not trigger, because they are source in this case
# the virtual node is not rebuild, to rebuild the dependencies must trigger
# the rule change doesn't matter

# note that all the nodes that have a builder, and are defined in the pbsfile,
# will rebuild, in this pbsrun, changing the pbsfile will rebuild node a
# because it has a digest but node 'other virtual' will not

# actually, 'other virtual' will never trigger
