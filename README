PBS/PBS version 
===============

Older presentation available at L<http://khemir.net/pnw_2004/>


B<PBS>/I<pbs.pl> is a build utility/module in the same spirit as  'make'.

PBS is among the new generation build systems:

rake: L<http://rake.rubyforge.org/>
scons
...


This module is pure perl. It is tested on linux and windows.

Special thanks go to Todd Merritt, author of Batch::PBS, to
allow us to use 'PBS' as namespace.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

INTRODUCTION

I<pbs.pl> is a build utility which uses Perl exclusively for defining rules.

If you have used 'make', I<pbs> should be easy to understand and use.

This is a beta (a developper) release of I<pbs> but this software has been
used for three years and I use it right now in a very serious project which
has 800 pbsfiles, 11000 nodes and  3 millions C code lines.

I<pbs> will continue to grow and I hope to get some help from the Open source 
community. I<pbs> has a limiting licence please read I<licence.txt>.

The biggest limitation is the lack of documentation but we are working on this
issue. You can have a look at the slide presentation I made at the Nordic
Perl Workshop in 2004. Some things have changed since then but it will give you
a nice overview.

I<pbs> has a test suite consisting of over 700 tests. We still work to make the 
coverage better.

Look at the test directory for some simple examples.

I hope this release will tickle your curiosity anf that we will hear from you.

TODO

Short time:

Write documentation.
Gather some help.
Create a web site, a mailing list, a bug tracker, faq, irc, ...

Long time:

Reduce the memory usage.
Perfect the test suite.
More speed (though the caching scheme we use today is very satisfying)
Find some solutions for making it faster on windows (same code big difference!)

Create a companion configuration and installation utility.

I am already planning next version of PBS (the 1.XX series) and there is some
material to think about in the TODO file.

CAUTION

Backup your source code! An error in your build sytem or in this build utility
might leave you without anything to work on.

* Math::Pari is required for remote compilation via SSH. This might not install
easily on Windows.

* Devel::Depend::Cpp is needed to depend C source on linux.

* Devel::Depend::Cl is needed to depend C source on windows.

* Data::TreeDumper on CPAN works in linux only. Mail me for a patch
or wait a short time for the comming update (within hours or days)
